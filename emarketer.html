    <h5>Measurement and Budget Go Hand in Hand</h5>
    <p>
With each passing year, more marketers are using social 
media, and their investments continue to grow. While some 
are increasing expenditures because they have had positive 
results, many more are investing in the hope that social media 
will pay dividends in the future. 
"It's a Catch-22," said Sarah Buchanan, director of digital 
strategy at roundhouse, a digital agency, in an interview with 
eMarketer. "We need to prove the worth of social but at the 
same time we can't get the resources and the budgets to 
prove it until we’ve proved that social works,"
In a February 2011 survey conducted by MarketingSherpa, 47% of 
companies in the strategic phase of social media development—
with a formal process and thorough guidelines for social media 
marketing—said they were able to measure ROI and would 
continue to spend money. However, only 17% of companies 
in the transition stage (with an informal process and a few 
guidelines for using social media marketing) and 16% in the trial 
stage of development (with no process or guidelines) agreed that 
they could measure ROI. Most companies in these phases were 
spending conservatively in the hopes of eventually producing ROI.</p>
